Executing program:


Description:
Open index.html with the browser and choose the file to use. The program is intended to rotate an image around the center of the image. However I was unable to get the coordinates to work correctly.

I used matrix transformations for the rotation. 
I was unable to get the animation to work as I could not figure out which pixels I need to put.

* index.html    -- a sample html file with a canvas
